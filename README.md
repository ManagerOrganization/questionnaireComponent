## Here is a questionnaire component written in Vue  
You just need to pass the data of the problem to the component, which will automatically generate the questionnaire for you.  
For example:  
<img src="./img/1.png" width="800px" height="800px" />
<img src="./img/2.png" width="800px" height="600px" />  
You'll get a questionnaire of your incoming data.  
<img src="./img/3.png" width="800px" height="200px" />
<img src="./img/4.png" width="800px" height="300px" />  
Of course, an important problem is that only one question is displayed at a time, and you can switch the topic by clicking on the last one or the next one.  
>This component can only generate three types of questions, single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions and short-answer questions, each corresponding to the type of 0, 1, 2, respectively.If necessary, you can customize the data.
